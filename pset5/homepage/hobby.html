            <h4>I have two main hobbies:</h4>
            <ol>
                <li> Sports: 
                    <p> My favourite sports include football, squash
                    as well as ultimate frisbee. I've been playing football
                    since my childhood years while I picked up squash later
                    around the age of 17 as that was when a squash court was
                    constructed in my club. Ultimate frisbee, as been my latest
                    experiment however, starting only a month back and it has won
                    its way into my heart !
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    Programming:
                    <p> 
                        I began programming right after 10th standard formally, with
                        a C course held in an institution in my locality. However I dabbled
                        in scripts even before that, on my iPhone(bash scripts automating
                        nothing much of import :P). My love for developing really blossomed
                        around 2 years ago, when I started programming in python Telegram Bots.
                        Ever since then it's been pretty much on and off, but the love and passion
                        always exists, something that this CS50 has been able to bring to the surface.
