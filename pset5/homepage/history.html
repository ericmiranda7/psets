        <p>I was first introduced to programming around 6 years ago on my iPhone. I had played around with bash scripts to automate something on my phone. Following this I joined a class that thought introduction to C, and a bit of C++. This being a regular syllabus oriented class, I did not enjoy it terribly. I chose a commerce background for my further studies not realising my passion for programming. During my graduate years I began playing around with Python for a Telegram bot I wanted to make. I made a few, and was taken up by the power of programming languages and what it might look like when applied practically. Now at the end of 5 years I've come to realise this is something I should not ignore. </p>
        <p>I'm now looking to do a masters in Computer Applications, one of the formal ways by which I can get into a computer field. This is why I am also doing CS50, in order to gain a background into computer science and "hit the ground running".</p>
